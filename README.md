### 👤 About

I'm an application security and offensive security professional with a privacy-first mindset, blending adversary techniques with a defensive-by-design approach.

Focus areas:

Adversary simulation & red teaming for web, API, and complex systems.

Application security exploitation — SQLi, XSS, SSRF, access control & authentication bypass.

Offensive privacy research — browser fingerprinting, metadata leaks, deanonymization vectors.

Protocol analysis & reverse engineering — from TLS quirks to embedded systems.

Custom tooling in Python/Bash/C to extend attack surfaces and simulate real-world threats.

Currently active in high assurance environments, contributing to open-source privacy/security projects, and publishing technical writeups on offensive techniques & privacy hardening.

Certifications: CRTO, OSCP, OSWP.
